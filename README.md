### Nine Day Fortnight ###

If you work a nine day fortnight as I do, where I get every other Friday off, then set `nineDayFortnightStartDay` to the date of a day in the calendar that is a day off e.g. `new Date(2017, 4, 12)`, then any dates a multiple of 14 days after that date will be shown as an off day.
